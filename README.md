Compressible Lattize Boltzmann (CLBM) solver is aimed to simulate supersonic flows to observe the strong shock formations in compressible media. This solver is developed for a collaborative masters thesis project between department of system simulation at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg and Fraunhofer Ernst-Mach-Institut.  
Most of the time Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) adopt structured grid in practice. A structured grid is represented by a regular grid where points on grid are are updated together and it has high spatial locality [1].
